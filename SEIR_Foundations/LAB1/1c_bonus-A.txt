Design goals
  EC2 is private (no public IP)
  No SSH required (use SSM Session Manager)
  Private subnets don’t need NAT to talk to AWS control-plane services
  Use VPC Interface Endpoints for:
    SSM, EC2Messages, SSMMessages (Session Manager)
    CloudWatch Logs
    Secrets Manager
    KMS (optional but realistic)
Use S3 Gateway Endpoint (common “gotcha” for private environments)
Tighten IAM: GetSecretValue only for your secret, GetParameter(s) only for your path

Note: If you remove NAT entirely, OS package installs can be tricky unless repos are reachable (often via S3). This skeleton gives you S3 endpoint and leaves NAT as optional “student choice.” In many orgs, teams use golden AMIs or image pipelines to avoid yum/apt internet needs in private subnets.
